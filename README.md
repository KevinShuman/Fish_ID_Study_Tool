# Where to start
So you like fish, turtles, water critters, but you don't know how to identify them? Guess what, pal? You're in the right place.

If you want to jump into things without thinking too much about it, you should probably do the following real quick for me.

Take a look at these dependencies and be honest, do you have these?

    PySimpleGUIQt, PIL

 Are you sure? If you don't, that's okay, but you should probably get them if you want to get this to work.

 Alright, assuming you have those, you need to git the code. Easy. Find a happy place on your computer and while in the cozy directory on your terminal type

    git clone https://github.com/KevinShuman/Fish_ID_Study_Tool.git

Did that work? If no, you probably need to put in your credentials for GitHub. Look it up. I'm not your friend.

If yes, great. Now cd into the Fish_ID_Study_Tool directory and get started by entering the following into your terminal:

    python Study_GUI.py

# So you want more info?

Great, I have more explaining to do. Can't you just figure it out yourself?
